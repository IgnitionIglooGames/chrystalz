**Questions / Bug reports / Suggestions**

All of these go to the appropriate place on GitHub.

ALWAYS include the version of Chrystalz that you have. A lot of things change, and without the version number it is pretty tough to verify the problem. Please try to be as specific as possible. A comment such as, "It crashes all the time," is too vague, and will not be of any real value in correcting the problem. Try to describe where you were and what you were doing, along with your system configuration, and the log file containing details of the crash, if Chrystalz crashed. macOS users can use System Profiler, in the Utilities folder, to generate a system report of their system configuration.

**What is the object of Chrystalz?**

Chrystalz is a rogue-like dungeon crawler role-playing game (RPG). You have been thrown into a dungeon, for whatever reason, and need to find the way out (real story to be added later).

**Some Tips:**

* Don't be shy about visiting the shops. The Healer, in particular, is important for keeping your health up.
* Battles can occur anywhere, at any time.
* If you get stuck, it may be because an event you need to trigger hasn't occurred yet.
